# Coursework on Methodology and Software Development Technologies

## Project Description

This project is a coursework for the subject "Methodology and Software Development Technologies." The main focus of the project is to explore and demonstrate the basics of LINQ (Language Integrated Query), its syntax, and its application in working with collections. LINQ is a powerful technology integrated into languages like C# and VB.NET, providing developers with an efficient way to query and manipulate data from different sources such as arrays, lists, XML, SQL databases, and more.

## Features

- Introduction to LINQ: Basic concepts and syntax.
- Using LINQ with collections: Arrays, Lists, and more.
- Comparing LINQ with traditional data processing methods.
- Practical examples and use cases of LINQ in software development.
